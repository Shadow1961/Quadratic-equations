# Quadratic-equations

Solving quadratic equations using the Java programming language. 

The quadratic.java program asks the user for the coefficients 
of the quadratic equation, passes them to the method that solves 
the equation, and displays the result. We do not deal with 
exception handling for incorrectly entered coefficients, 
we only minimally check that they cannot be zero, nor do we deal 
with cases where the quadratic equation is incomplete. 

We use static programming and do not create objects.
