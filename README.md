# Quadratic-equations

Solving quadratic equations using the Java programming language. 

The quadratic.java program asks the user for the coefficients 
of the quadratic equation, passes them to the method that solves 
the equation, and displays the result. We do not cover exception 
handling for incorrectly entered coefficients or cases where 
the quadratic equation is incomplete. 

We use static programming and do not create objects.
